      <h3>1984: Macintosh 128K</h3>
      </br>
      <p>
        The Mac placed the scrollbar on the right to fit their idea of resizable windows. The users could also move the
        screen up and down by clicking either above or below the grabbable area of the scroll bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Macintosh 128K, originally released as the Apple Macintosh, is the original Apple Macintosh personal
        computer. Its beige case consisted of a 9 in (23 cm) CRT monitor and came with a keyboard and mouse. A handle
        built into the top of the case made it easier for the computer to be lifted and carried. It had an initial
        selling price of $2,495 (equivalent to $6,017 in 2018). The Macintosh was introduced by the now-famous $370,000
        (equivalent to $892,290 in 2018) television commercial by Ridley Scott, "1984", that aired on CBS during the
        third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[6] Sales of the Macintosh were strong from its initial
        release on January 24, 1984, and reached 70,000 units on May 3, 1984.[7] Upon the release of its successor, the
        Macintosh 512K, it was rebranded as the Macintosh 128K. This computer did not have a model number.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Macintosh shipped with the very first System and Finder application, known to the public as "System 1.0"
        (formally known as System 0.97 and Finder 1.0). The original Macintosh saw three upgrades to both before it was
        discontinued. Apple recommends System 2.0 and Finder 4.2, with System 3.2 and Finder 5.3 as the maximum. System
        4.0 officially dropped support for the Macintosh 128K because it was distributed on 800 KB floppy disks, which
        could not be used by the 128K.

        The applications MacPaint and MacWrite were bundled with the Mac. Other programs available included MacProject,
        MacTerminal and Microsoft Word. Programming languages available at the time included MacBASIC, MacPascal[11] and
        the Macintosh 68000 Development System.[12] The Macintosh also came with a manual and a unique guided tour
        cassette tape which worked together with the guided tour diskette as a tutorial for both the Macintosh itself
        and the bundled applications, since most new Macintosh users had never used a mouse before, much less
        manipulated a graphical user interface.
