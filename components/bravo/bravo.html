      <h3>1974: Xerox PARC Bravo</h3>
      </br>
      <p>
        Bravo was the first WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor on the Xerox Alto personal computer. It had
        some of the first scrollable interactions on a document that involved a mouse that had three buttons. To scroll,
        the user would move the cursor to the left margin, and the cursor would change shape to a double arrow. Using
        the mouse, clicking the left button will scroll up, the right button will scroll down, and the middle button
        will take the relative vertical mouse position and jump to that relative position in the document. For example,
        if you clicked the middle button at the top of the left margin, the document will scroll to the very top, and if
        you click the middle button halfway down the left margin, it will scroll the middle of the document.

      </p>
      <p>
        Bravo was a modal editorâ€”characters typed on the keyboard were usually commands to Bravo, except when in
        "insert" or "append" mode, in which case they were entered into the character buffer. Bravo made extensive use
        of the mouse for marking locations in the text, as well as selecting areas of the text, but it was not used for
        command entry. (Being at the very dawn of graphical user interface design, a non-command driven interface was
        judged too ambitious and possibly even inefficient and cumbersome.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Bravo usually displayed the text with formatting (e.g. with justification, fonts, and proportional
        spacing of characters), it did not normally attempt to reproduce the way a page would look in hardcopy. This was
        because the Alto monitor provided a resolution of 72 pixels per inch, but the laser printers used at PARC
        provided a resolution of 300 PPI. This meant that the screen could at best only provide an approximation of the
        way the page would look when printed. Instead, the normal display mode showed the text using character sizes,
        etc., more suited to the capability of the display.
