      <h3>1977: XEROX PARC Smalltalk</h3>
      </br>
      <p>
        SmallTalk was one of the first programs to allow user to grab and move the scrollbar to the desired position in
        the document. It had three vertical sections, clicking in the left section scrolled down, clicking in the right
        section scrolled up, and grabbing the center bar allowed the scrollbar to be moved. The center bar will show you
        the percent that is visible to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language. Smalltalk was created as the
        language in underpinning the "new world" of computing exemplified by "humanâ€“computer symbiosis".[2] It was
        designed and created in part for educational use, more so for constructionist learning, at the Learning Research
        Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace, and others
        during the 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The language was first generally released as Smalltalk-80. Smalltalk-like languages are in continuing active
        development and have gathered loyal communities of users around them. ANSI Smalltalk was ratified in 1998 and
        represents the standard version of Smalltalk.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk took second place for "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in
        2017,[4] but it was not among the 26 most loved programming languages of the 2018 survey.[5]
